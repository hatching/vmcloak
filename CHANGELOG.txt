0.2.12, September 8th 2015

    Tweak: Handle an unwanted message boxes from Windows.

0.2.11, September 7th 2015

    Tweak: The --clonehd feature is now obsolete. It turns out multiattach
        mode is capable of doing what we are interested in after all.

0.2.10, September 6th 2015

    Feature: Update hostname for each clone to avoid duplicate hostname errors.
    Feature: Add clonehd feature for cloning (multiattach) harddisks in
        situations where this is required - namely, when Virtual Machines
        using this bird image are already running.
    Tweak: Moved default data-dir from ~/vm-data/ to ~/vms/.

0.2.9, September 5th 2015

    Important: Fixed issue with immutable disks - apparently they're not as
        immutable as one would hope. Using multiattach disks and attaching
        them to new Virtual Machines as multiattach they are truly immutable.
        As a side-effect the bird image would take parts of the first created
        clone, introducing odd issues with IP addresses and all that.
    Remove: Outdated and probably nonfunctional bridged networking support.
    Feature: When creating a bird image VRDE is automatically enabled.
    Feature: Pass along RDP ports to longcuckoo.

0.2.8, August 29th 2015

    Tweak: Use "USB Tablet" to set Absolute Pointing Device which improves
        VRDE support (thanks to kuza for this feature).
    Tweak: When connecting to the host fails (in the Agent), wait a little bit
        before trying again, this resulted in 99% CPU usage.
    Tweak: Log the source IP and port when a clone connects back.

0.2.7, August 3rd 2015

    Tweak: Do not require --cuckoo when creating a bird image.
    New: Introduce --vmmode longterm to vmcloak-clone.
    Feature: Do not delete the Agent in longterm mode.
    Feature: Allow specification of a netmask in vmcloak-vboxnet0.

0.2.6, June 25th 2015

    New: Disable Windows updates.
    New: Allow manual modification of Virtual Machines by removing the
        Cuckoo Agent (and its associated registry key) at a later time.
    Tweak: Debug mode in which python.exe is uses instead of pythonw.exe.

0.2.5, May 31th 2015

    Fixed: It seems I was uploading my development versions to pypi instead
        of the actual version. This should be fixed now.
    Tweak: Allow one to actually use the VRDE stream by providing a known
        default password.

0.2.4, May 30th 2015

    Tweak: Get rid of vmcloak-deps' urls.txt in favor of our self-hosted
        binaries at http://cuckoo.sh/vmcloak-files/.
    Tweak: Remove birds.json file when running vmcloak-removevms.

0.2.3, May 26th 2015

    Release as I forgot to properly update setup.py with the latest
    version number.

0.2.2, May 26th 2015

        when creating a bird image.

    New: Experimental Windows 7 support.

0.1.22, March 3rd 2015

    Feature: Have vmcloak-clone wait at most 5 minutes per Virtual Machine.
        If the machine has not pinged back in that time, something's wrong.
    Tweak: Move Windows XP related files to vmcloak/data/winxp.

0.1.21, December 11th 2014

        when listening on a port.
    New: Introduce vmcloak-bird for basic management of Virtual Machine birds.

0.1.20, December 11th 2014

    Bugfix: --deps-directory still used the old $HOME value.

        dropping privileges to another user.

        in a longterm analysis (this only works in bird mode).
    Tweak: Renamed -d/--debug to -v/--verbose and -v/--version to --version.
    New: Introduced --version-int for comparison when scripting.

    Feature: Ability to drop privileges to another user.

0.1.15, November 29th 2014
