0.2.13, September 14th 2015

    Tweak: Handle an unwanted message boxes from Windows.

0.2.11, September 7th 2015

    Feature: Update hostname for each clone to avoid duplicate hostname errors.
    Feature: Add clonehd feature for cloning (multiattach) harddisks in

    Tweak: Moved default data-dir from ~/vm-data/ to ~/vms/.

0.2.9, September 5th 2015

    Important: Fixed issue with immutable disks - apparently they're not as
        immutable as one would hope. Using multiattach disks and attaching
        them to new Virtual Machines as multiattach they are truly immutable.
        As a side-effect the bird image would take parts of the first created
        clone, introducing odd issues with IP addresses and all that.
    Remove: Outdated and probably nonfunctional bridged networking support.
    Feature: When creating a bird image VRDE is automatically enabled.
    Feature: Pass along RDP ports to longcuckoo.

0.2.8, August 29th 2015

        VRDE support (thanks to kuza for this feature).
    Tweak: When connecting to the host fails (in the Agent), wait a little bit
        before trying again, this resulted in 99% CPU usage.

0.2.5, May 31th 2015

        of the actual version. This should be fixed now.

        default password.
